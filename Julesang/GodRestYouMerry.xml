<l>God rest you merry, gentlemen,</l>
<l>Let nothing you dismay,</l>
<l>For Jesus Christ, our Saviour,</l>
<l>Was born upon this day,</l>
<l>To save us all from Satan’s power</l>
<l>When we were gone astray;</l>
</lg>
<lg n="refrain">
<l>O tidings of comfort and joy, Comfort and joy,</l>
<l>O tidings of comfort and joy.</l>
</lg>
<lg n="2">
<l>In Bethlehem in Jewry</l>
<l>This blessèd babe was born,</l>
<l>And laid within a manger</l>
<l>Upon this blessèd morn;</l>
<l>The which his mother Mary</l>
<l>Did nothing take in scorn.</l>
</lg><lg n="3">
<l>From God our heavenly Father</l>
<l>A blesséd angel came.</l>
<l>And unto certain shepherds</l>
<l>Brought tidings of the same,</l>
<l>How that in Bethlehem was born</l>
<l>The Son of God by name.</l>
</lg><lg n="4">
<l>“Fear not,” then said the angel,</l>
<l>“Let nothing you affright;</l>
<l>This day is born a Saviour,</l>
<l>Of virtue, power and might;</l>
<l>So frequently to vanquish all</l>
<l>The friends of Satan quite.”</l>
</lg><lg n="5">
<l>The shepherds at those tiding</l>
<l>Rejoicèd much in mind,</l>
<l>And le& their flocks a-feeding,</l>
<l>In tempest, storm and wind,</l>
<l>And went to Bethlehem straightway</l>
<l>This blessèd babe to find.</l>
</lg><lg n="6">
<l>But when to Bethlehem they came,</l>
<l>Whereat this infant lay</l>
<l>They found him in a manger,</l>
<l>Where oxen feed on hay;</l>
<l>His mother Mary, kneeling down,</l>
<l>Unto the Lord did pray.</l>
</lg><lg n="7">
<l>Now to the Lord sing praises,</l>
<l>All you within this place,</l>
<l>And with true love and brotherhood</l>
<l>Each other now embrace;</l>
<l>The holy tide of Christmas</l>
<l>Is drawing on apace.</l>
